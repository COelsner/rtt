RegressionTestTool (RTT)
========================

A regression test tool for any type of java based program. The components to be regression tested just need to be marked by special Java annotations. Further code changes are not required. RTT comes with an own test archive system, fully equipped with input and output data versioning. A dedicated Eclipse Plug-in is also available.

This repository is used for a complete new version of RTT and currently shouldn't be used in productive use, because of eventual basic annotation or archive structure changes.

For further details about the last stable version of RTT, please check the previous project homepage: http://rtt.googlecode.com
